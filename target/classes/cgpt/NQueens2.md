# Q

Can you refactor this code to be non-recursive using a Stack? Please only use the stack to replace the recursion. Give the final version as NQueens2 in the same package.

# A

Sure! Here's a non-recursive version of the N-Queens solution using a Stack to replace the recursion. The class is named NQueens2 and is in the cgpt package:

See `NQueens2.java`

In this version, I've replaced the recursive solve method with a Stack. The Stack stores the column index, and a while loop continues until the Stack is empty. Inside the loop, we check if a safe row is found for the current column. If a safe row is found, we either push the next column index onto the stack (if it's not the last column) or print the solution (if it's the last column). If no safe row is found, we backtrack by popping the current column index from the stack and incrementing the row value for the previous column index. The other methods (isSafe and printSolution) remain the same.
