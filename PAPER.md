# Paper Idea(s)

This could be two ideas but here are two possibilities

- Paper focused on ChatGPT for CS1 nad CS2 courses.  (I think we are the right people to do this, even if others are doing it.)
- Paper focused on ChatGPT's ability to cover the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula

# Apparatus

We can literally start from the content of any of the "flagship" CS1 or CS2 texts.

Here is how I have been engineering my prompts. I really don't like this term, because inquiry is the nature of scientific investigation.
I'd like to see us focus on scientific investigation, which also immunizes our work from those who seek to overly praise or criticise the tech.
Our investigation aims to determine usefulness of the technology and understand its limitations.
I want to steer clear of the culture war stuff and focus on how we can use this tech to improve teaching and make CS more relevant to students and the workforce, most of whom do not have CS or programming skills and are looking to the academy to improve access. (We can really help here.)

# Prompts I have tried thus far

- Start by asking whether the AI knows a certain topic, e.g., Do you know about the N-queens problem?
- If it is highly general, ask what are the top N or key ideas associated with that topic.
- For each idea:
  - Is there a minimum viable example for this idea.
  - Compile and run the solution.
  - If it does not compile, seek clarification from CGPT

# Archival

- Every prompt in a sequence should be numbered from 0.
- Open topicN.md and record the prompt and response.
- Note that CGPT gives Markdown output. This lends itself to copy/paste.
- Add an Analysis section that critiques the solution.
- Follow up to CGPT with some concrete suggestions for improving the solution.

Repeat until you have a solution that rocks or can no longer make progress (rare)

We want to save every version based on the conversation.
