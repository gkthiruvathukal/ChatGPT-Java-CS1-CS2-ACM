# Q

Can you rewrite the recursion to use a Queue instead of a Stack?

# A

Sure! Here's a version of the N-Queens solution using a Queue instead of a Stack. The class is named NQueens3 and is in the cgpt package:

See `NQueens3.java`

In this version, I've replaced the Stack with a Queue. The Queue stores the column index. The code structure is similar to the stack-based solution, but with minor changes to work with a queue. The main difference is that we use a while loop to iterate through rows while the current column is being processed. When a safe row is found, we add the next column index to the queue, and the loop is broken to process the next column in the queue. If no safe row is found, we reset the current column's row value to 0 and increment the previous column's row value. The other methods (isSafe and printSolution) remain the same.

Please note that this queue-based solution does not perform as well as the stack-based solution in terms of time complexity, as it processes more nodes than necessary. The queue-based approach is closer to a breadth-first search, while the stack-based approach is a depth-first search. For N-Queens, the depth-first search is more efficient.
