# Q

Ok, this is great, but can you refactor this to represent the board as a 1D array instead of 2D?  Since each position on the board has a unique position, it should be possible? Can name the final version as NQueens1 and put it in package cgpt?

# A

Certainly! Here's the refactored version of the N-Queens solution using a 1D array to represent the board. The class is named NQueens1 and is in the cgpt package:

See `NQueens1.java`

In this version, the board is represented as a 1D array where each index corresponds to a column, and its value corresponds to the row where the queen is placed. The solve method remains mostly the same, but now assigns the row value to the board array directly. The isSafe method is modified to account for the 1D array representation. The printSolution method is also adjusted to print the board correctly based on the 1D array.
